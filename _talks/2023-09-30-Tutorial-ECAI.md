This tutorial presents a rigorous examination of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), an emergent field that fortifies the intersection of collaboration, efficiency, and privacy in artificial intelligence systems. The tutorial systematically explores the underlying principles, architectures, components, security strategies, and optimization techniques inherent to DFL. Moreover, participants will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with Fedstellar, a platform for training DFL models, and delve into real-world use cases, effectively marrying theory with practice. Attendees will gain an understanding of practical applications, as well as a vision of future trends, encapsulating the transformative potential of DFL in the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and associated domains.
