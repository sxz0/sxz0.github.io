### Summary

In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the identification and protection of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become paramount. This thesis focuses on **device behavior fingerprinting**, especially for resource-constrained systems such as single-board computers used in Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, and the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT).

Key research questions addressed include:
- Can ML/DL techniques effectively identify individual IoT devices?
- How resilient are these techniques to adversarial attacks?
- Can advanced models like transformers improve fingerprinting?

The methodology involves extensive data collection from Raspberry Pi models and the development of **LwHBench**, a tool for low-level benchmarking of CPU, GPU, memory, and storage. This dataset supports ML/DL training for device identification.

A major contribution is the **SpecForce framework**, integrating hardware fingerprinting with behavioral analysis to detect malware and SSDF attacks in IoBT. Adversarial defense strategies and authentication frameworks based on transformers are also explored.

This work advances the field by:
- Establishing new datasets and benchmarks
- Demonstrating robust ML/DL-based fingerprinting methods
- Validating integration with cybersecurity frameworks in real-world scenarios
