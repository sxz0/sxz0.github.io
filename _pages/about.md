I am **Pedro Miguel Sánchez Sánchez**, a **Senior Researcher** specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Federated Learning**, and **Cybersecurity** at **Funditec** in **Madrid, Spain**. With a strong focus on **trustworthy AI** and **decentralized learning paradigms**, my research explores how **intelligent systems** can be deployed **securely**, **fairly**, and **robustly** in real-world settings, especially in **IoT** and **critical infrastructure environments**.

My academic journey began with a **B.Sc.** and **M.Sc.** in **Computer Science** from the **University of Murcia**, where I specialized in **secure continuous authentication for smart devices**. I later earned a **Ph.D. in Computer Science (Cum Laude)** from the same institution. My **doctoral research**, conducted in close collaboration with **armasuisse S&T** in **Switzerland**, was centered on **behavioral fingerprinting of IoT devices** for **identification** and **attack detection** using **Machine and Deep Learning**.

In my **last PhD stage and Post-PhD**, my work has pivoted toward cutting-edge topics in **Decentralized Federated Learning**, **adversarial robustness**, and **AI model explainability**, contributing to **European defence** and **digital sovereignty** through projects such as **EU-GUARDIAN (EDF)** and **ROBUST-6G (Horizon Europe)**. Afterwards, I moved to **Funditec**, where I focus on **applied ML/DL and cybersecurity research**, as well as **European and National research grant preparation**, **project execution**, and **administration**.

This website presents an overview of my work, achievements, and collaborations. You can explore my peer-reviewed publications, conferences, and projects. The site is continuously updated and serves as a central hub for my academic and research activities.
