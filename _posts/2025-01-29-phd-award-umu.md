My doctoral research focused on identifying identical IoT devices by analyzing low-level hardware performance variations using machine learning techniques. The goal was to build more secure systems by detecting tampering, substitution, or unauthorized device replacements — a growing concern in connected and critical environments. This work contributes to improving device-level security through non-invasive behavioral fingerprinting.
