After completing my postdoctoral stage at the **University of Murcia**, I am excited to share that I have joined **Funditec** (Advantx Technology Foundation) in Madrid as a **Senior Researcher**.

At the University of Murcia, I focused on **federated learning**, **trustworthy AI**, and **cybersecurity**, contributing to projects like **EU-GUARDIAN** and **ROBUST-6G**, and collaborating closely with **armasuisse S+T**. This phase was key to deepening my work on secure distributed systems and behavioral fingerprinting.

Joining Funditec marks a transition from academic research to applied innovation. I will continue working on **machine learning**, **secure architectures**, and **AI-driven cybersecurity** in the context of national and European R&D initiatives. My role includes not just technical research, but also strategic participation in **project design, grant preparation, and execution** â€” connecting research with real-world impact.

I'm looking forward to this new chapter, where I can apply and extend the experience gained during my PhD and postdoc into a broader mission-driven environment focused on building trustworthy and resilient digital systems.
